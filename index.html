<h1>School Life</h1>
<img id="turf" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D41SCS-WkAEmIYD.jpg">
<h2>Rooftop Turf</h2>
<p>The Rooftop is normally where we have all our sports events. It is a lot of fun to play Football on the turf. We also have a 50 meter pool. The rooftop is my favourite place in the school because it is a lot of fun to play Football over there. </p></div><hr>

<h2>Auditorium</h2>
<p>I really like the Auditorium because it is very big and useful. We use the Auditorium for plays,musical's, movie's or an important announcement. When there is an important announce mostly everyone for Grade 1-5 come to the Auditorium. It is also very entertaining to watch what is being shown. </p><hr>

<h2>Lobby</h2>
<p>I like the lobby because thats the first place I see when I enter the building. It is also where you meet up with your friends before you go up for your classes. The lobby is a very nice place also because you can just chat and do nothing till you go up. </p><hr>

<h1>Whats New</h1>
<h2>MYP</h2>
<img src="https://oberoi-is.org/img/learning/mypios-bg.jpg">
<p>

The Middle Years Programme is a rigorous and challenging  five year programme  for 11 to 16 year olds.  MYP encourages students  to make practical connections between their studies and the real world, preparing them for success in further study and in life.

The programme empowers students to inquire into a wide range of issues and ideas of significance locally, nationally and globally. The result is young people who are creative, critical and reflective thinkers.

At OIS, students can opt to pursue MYP Certificate, MYP course or a school based MYP certificate. The following table outlines the subjects and pathways offered through the five years of the programme:
OIS JVLR have added 9th and 10th grade recently to MYP. Lots of students have joined and more are to come. They also may be planning to add 11th and 12th grade to MYP.

<h2>ECA</h2>
<img src="https://oberoi-is.org/img/jvrlcampus/DSC_3246.jpg">
<p>The ECA program is designed to provide our students with an opportunity to have enriching experiences beyond the normal school day. The primary goal of ECAs is for students to have fun while learning important life skills and developing mastery of certain skills. The program is not competitively driven, but instead, is focused on exposing students to new experiences and enriching their lives. ECAs will allow students to try new experiences or participate in areas they are already passionate about. Each ECA aims to be student centered and to maximize student participation in the activity.

In semester 1 ECAs are run from first week of September until mid-December, and in semester 2 from the first week of February to mid-May tentatively. ECAs run from 3:00 p.m. - 4:10 p.m. on weekdays.
More and more ECA's are being added and more students are joining them. There are ECA'S of all types like Sports based,Annual ECA,Perfomance Based and Class room based.</p></section></center>
